* Designed a framework integrating vision-language semantic mapping(VLMap) with LLM-based
task planning to enable natural language instruction following for indoor robots
* Implemented a zero-shot object localization from RGB-D and LiDAR data, and generated
collision-free trajectories via A* path planning
* Validated the system on an F1TENTH-scale autonomous vehicle, achieving structured
multi-object pick-and-place tasks.
