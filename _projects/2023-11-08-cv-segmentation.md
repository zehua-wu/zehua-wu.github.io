* Implemented various image operations and transformations, including rotation, mosaic, sampling, quantization, and shifting, and applied digital image processing techniques such as
2D convolution, spatial convolution, Gaussian kernels, and order-statistic filters
* Implemented practical image processing algorithms, including Canny Edge Detection, bilateral
filtering, histogram equalization, and Adaptive Histogram Equalization
* Designed and implemented semantic segmentation models using FCN8s with VGG16 as the
backbone in TensorFlow, applying the model to a 12-class image segmentation dataset
* Developed DeepLab v3 model with ResNet-50 and Xception-65 as backbones, achieving 80.5%
accuracy on the test dataset for a 12-class transportation scenario segmentation task
