* Extracted spatial-temporal consistent 3D point clouds of trowel and bricks from human
demonstration videos using CoTracker and Depth-Anything-2
* Performed trajectory extraction of workers’ spreading mortar motion, and performed 3D scene
reconstruction of major objects with PyVista
* Explored motion trajectory generation for spreading mortar actions using Linear
Parameter-Varying Dynamical System and Probabilistic Movement Primitives
* Investigated geometry constraints within the reconstructed scene using basic constraint models
to design motion policies
